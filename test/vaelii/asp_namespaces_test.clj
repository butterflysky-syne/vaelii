  "The test namespaces that check for an answer-set solver, listed by name.

  A solver test is wrapped in `(when asp? …)`, where `asp?` is `(solver/available?)`
  read at namespace load.  On a box with no solver the body does not run and the
  namespace still reports as passing, so these namespaces assert nothing about the
  subsystem unless CI puts a solver on the box first.  The `asp` job in
  `.github/workflows/test.yml` is that job, and it runs the list
  `scripts/asp-namespaces.sh` derives from the tree.

  The job derives that list on every run, so a namespace that starts reading
  `solver/available?` is covered the day it lands.  This test compares the derived
  set with the list below, so the set *changing* is a red suite and a diff a
  reviewer sees, rather than a silent widening of what one CI job runs.

  ## On failure

  - **A namespace in the scan and not in the list.**  A new namespace is conditional on
    the solver.  Add it to `solver-namespaces` — the `asp` job already runs it.
  - **A namespace in the list and not in the scan.**  Its availability call is gone.
    Either the tests no longer need a solver, in which case take the row out, or the
    availability call was dropped by accident and those tests now fail on a box with no solver.
  - **The script prints nothing.**  The scan pattern no longer matches how the availability
    call is spelled, which turns the `asp` job into a no-op.  Fix `scripts/asp-namespaces.sh`,
    not this list."
